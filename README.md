# STM32 Command Line Builder Project

This project provides an automated method for building and flashing STM32 microcontrollers from the Linux command line. It leverages a Makefile to streamline the process. Follow the instructions below to set up and use the project.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

### üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements:
- **Linux Operating System** with `sudo` privileges.
- **STM32 microcontroller board** connected to your system before flashing.
- **Internet connection** for downloading tools and dependencies.

### üîß Tools You Need:
Make sure you have the following tools installed on your Linux system:

- `wget` or `curl`
- `tar` (for file extraction)
- `git` (for cloning repositories)
- `make` (to compile the project)
- `unzip` (to extract files)
- `stlink-tools` (for communication with STM32)

Install the missing tools with:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install wget tar git make unzip stlink-tools -y
```

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install ARM GCC Toolchain

To build STM32 firmware, you will need the ARM GCC toolchain.

### üì• Download ARM GCC Toolchain

1. Visit the [ARM GCC Toolchain Download Page](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm).
2. Download the `.tar.bz2` file appropriate for your system.

### üõ†Ô∏è Install the Toolchain

#### 1.1 Download the Toolchain

Use `wget` or `curl` to download the file:

```bash
wget <download_link>
```

Replace `<download_link>` with the actual URL.

#### 1.2 Extract the Toolchain

Extract the downloaded file to your working directory:

```bash
tar -xjf <downloaded_file> -C <working_directory>
```

#### 1.3 Move Toolchain to Standard Location (Optional)

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/arm-gcc
sudo mv <working_directory>/<extracted_directory> /opt/arm-gcc
```

#### 1.4 Set Up Environment Variables

To add the ARM GCC toolchain to your `PATH`:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=/opt/arm-gcc/<toolchain_directory>/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

#### 1.5 Verify Installation

Run this command to confirm the toolchain is installed:

```bash
arm-none-eabi-gcc --version
```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install `stlink-tools`

`stlink-tools` is required for flashing the STM32 microcontroller.

### üõ†Ô∏è Install `stlink-tools`

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install stlink-tools
```

### üìù Verify Installation

To confirm `stlink-tools` are installed correctly, run:

```bash
st-info --version
```

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Project Repository

To get the project, clone it using `git`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abhishekweslee/STM32_Command_line_bulder.git
```

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Extract Project Files

After cloning the repository, unzip the project archive:

```bash
cd STM32_Command_line_bulder/
unzip STM32_command_line.zip
```

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Customize Project Directories

Since this is a **generic template** for STM32 microcontrollers, you'll need to replace the contents of the `Core` and `Drivers` directories with your own files for the specific STM32 microcontroller you're using.

### üîÑ Replace Core and Drivers Directories

1. **Core Directory**: Replace the contents with your STM32-specific core files, such as:
   - Startup files
   - Linker scripts
   - System initialization code

   Example structure for `Core`:
   ```bash
   Core/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Inc/         # Header files
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Src/         # Source files
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Startup/     # Startup files
   ```

2. **Drivers Directory**: Replace with your specific STM32 microcontroller drivers:
   - CMSIS drivers
   - HAL drivers

   Example structure for `Drivers`:
   ```bash
   Drivers/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CMSIS/       # CMSIS drivers
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ STM32F4xx_HAL_Driver/   # STM32 HAL drivers
   ```

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Project

### üöÄ Navigate to the Project Directory

After replacing the files in the `Core` and `Drivers` directories, go to the project folder:

```bash
cd CLI_STM32_Project/
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Build the Project

To compile the firmware, run the following command:

```bash
make all
```

This may take a few minutes depending on your system and the project size.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Clean the Build (Optional)

If you need to clean the project (for example, after code changes), run:

```bash
make clean
```

This will remove all generated object and binary files.

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Rebuild the Project (If Needed)

After cleaning or making changes, you can rebuild the project:

```bash
make all
```

---

## 9Ô∏è‚É£ Flash the STM32 Microcontroller

Before flashing, make sure the STM32 microcontroller is connected to your system.

### üö® Flash Firmware to STM32

Once the build is complete, you can flash the firmware to the STM32 using:

```bash
make flash
```

This will use `stlink-tools` to flash the firmware to the microcontroller.

---

## üìå Conclusion

With this guide, you have:
- Set up the ARM GCC toolchain.
- Installed `stlink-tools`.
- Customized the `Core` and `Drivers` directories for your STM32 microcontroller.
- Built the project and flashed the STM32 firmware.

You're now ready to develop and debug your STM32 applications!
